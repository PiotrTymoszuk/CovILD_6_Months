Recovery from any COVID-19 symptoms in the participants stratified by acute COVID-19 severity (__A__) and particular complaints in the entire cohort (__B__) was investigated by mixed-effect logistic modeling (random effect: individual, fixed effect: time). Significance was determined by likelihood ratio test and p values corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Percents of individuals with symptoms at the indicated time points are presented, p values and numbers of complete observations are indicated in the plots.

Recovery from any lung CT abnormalities, moderate-to-severe lung CT abnormalities (severity score > 5) and functional lung impairment was investigated in the participants stratified by acute COVID-19 severity by mixed-effect logistic modeling (random effect: individual, fixed effect: time). Significance was determined by likelihood ratio test and p values corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Clustering of `r length(cov_univariate$mod_vars)` non-CT and non-lung function binary explanatory variables recorded for acute COVID-19 (V0) or at the early 60-day follow-up visit (V1) (__Supplementary Table S1__) was investigated by PAM algorithm with simple matching distance (SMD) dissimilarity measure (__Supplementary Figure S4__, __Supplementary Table S3__). The cluster assignment for the outcome variables  at the 180-day follow-up visit (V3, persistent symptoms, functional lung impairment, mild lung CT abnormalities [severity score $\leq$ 5] and moderate-to-severe lung CT abnormalities [severity score > 5]) was predicted by k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) label propagation procedure. Numbers of complete observations and numbers of features in the clusters are indicated in (__A__).

Frequencies of outcome variables at the 180-day follow-up visit (V3, mild [severity score $\leq$ 5], moderate-to-severe lung CT abnormalities [severity score > 5)], functional lung impairment and persistent symptoms) were compared between the low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) participant clusters by $\chi^2$ test corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Single machine learning classifiers (C5.0, RF: random forests, SVM-R: support vector machines with radial kernel, NNet: neural network, glmNet: elastic net) and their ensemble (Ens) were trained in the cohort data set with `r length(cov_univariate$mod_vars)` non-CT and non-lung function binary explanatory variables recorded for acute COVID-19 (V0) or at the early 60-day follow-up visit (V1) (__Supplementary Table S1__) for predicting outcome variables at the 180-day follow-up visit (V3, any lung CT abnormalities, moderate-to-severe lung CT abnormalities [severity score > 5], functional lung impairment and persistent symptoms) (__Supplementary Table S4__). The prediction accuracy was verified by repeated 20-fold cross-validation (5 repeats). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the algorithms in the cross-validation are presented: area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sens) and specificity (Spec) (__Supplementary Table S5__). Numbers of complete observations and outcome events are indicated under the plots.

The machine learning classifier ensemble (Ens) was developed as presented in __Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ml)__. Its performance at predicting outcome variables at the 180-day follow-up visit (V3, any CT lung abnormalities, moderate-to-severe lung CT abnormalities [severity score > 5], functional lung impairment and persistent symptoms in the entire cohort, mild-to-moderate (outpatient or hospitalized without oxygen) and severe-to-critical COVID-19 convalescents (oxygen therapy or ICU) in repeated 20-fold cross-validation (5 repeats) was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (__Supplementary Table S6__). ROC curves and statistics (AUC: area under the curve, Se: sensitivity, Sp: specificity) in the cross-validation are shown. Numbers of complete observations and outcome events are indicated in the plots.
